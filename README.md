### Hi!! I'm Cailyn (she/her) - welcome to my Github! ðŸŽ‰

During working hours you can find me working on Auth0 by Okta's Cloud/Infrastructure Security! These days I am particularly interested in Kubernetes Security - and spend my free time working with K8s SIG-Security, SIG-CLI and playing around with home automation using Home Assistant.

My learning goals at the moment are around baking security practices into development practice as early and seamlessly as possible. I am also focused on deepening my network security, and low level systems knowledge.
